## FTP 000: Federation Transition Proposal Template

Provide a high level description here.   You can choose a number or let editors pick one for you. Use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sip-randomize-block-rewards.md`.

When your proposal is in Final form, open a pull request to submit your sip.  



## Abstract

Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the Change proposed. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this request is.


## Motivation

The motivation section should describe the "why" of this sip. What problem does it solve? Why should someone want to implement this change to the federation? What benefit does it provide to the Ethereum ecosystem? What use cases does this sip address? 

If for Federation member expansion or subtraction, what does the participant bring to the network?


## Specification

Complete detail.


## Security Considerations

If security considerations are relevant, what does the proposed transition enable? what are the benefits? what are the risks? Please clearly identify the changes this creates to the federation, network, or other areas.
