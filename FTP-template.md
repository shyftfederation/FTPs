This is the suggested template for new sips.

Note that an sip number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your sip, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sip-draft_title_abbrev.md`.

The title should be 44 characters or less. It should not repeat the sip number in title, irrespective of the category. 

## Abstract
Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the Change proposed. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this request is.


## Motivation
The motivation section should describe the "why" of this sip. What problem does it solve? Why should someone want to implement this change to the federation? What benefit does it provide to the Ethereum ecosystem? What use cases does this sip address? 

If for Federation member expansion or subtraction, what does the participant bring to the network?

## Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the transition by describing what motivated the creation of the proposal and why particular decisions were made. It should describe alternative options if application and alternative designs that were considered if applicable.


## Security Considerations
If security considerations are relevant, what does the proposed transition enable? what are the benefits? what are the risks? Please clearly identify the changes this creates to the federation, network, or other areas.
